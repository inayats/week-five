This week, we looked at presenting digital history, with some familiar formats (posters, maps) and some unfamiliar ones (sonification). It was an interesting overview of formats ranging from sound to image. After several weeks of focusing on acquiring and analyzing digital materials, it was an awkward pivot into then figuring out how to present that information in a usable format.

In Sonification, I listened to Christina Wood's "Songs of the Ottawa" project. The "Hearing the River's Flows" track explores the river's hydrological cycle. It's based on a Reveal News project to adapt earthquake frequency data for a radio story. I found sonification interesting as a way to present data in sound, something that is usually difficult to do, especially without using narration. Using sonification, Reveal could present information to listeners not having access to video or images (they were listening to a podcast, they were in their car etc;). A sonification of the data could make it accessible in ways beyond the obvious text and graphic-based go-to mediums.

I tried sonification for COVID-19 data (looking at number of cases a week and number of cases per day). Could this be another way of presenting a daily update to people? In addition to traditional formats like radio, I think of all the new ways people are listening to audio - such as through sound-enabled smart speakers. Sonification could have a practical role in presenting information through these devices, in addition to its scientific role in various instruments (geiger counters, sonar).

We had done some presentation work previously, for example by generating graphs in R Studio. But that was all for our own usage, and presenting this work involves its own set of considerations (along with separate software tools). 

There seems to be a line between the tools we used to collect/analyze and the tools we used to present. The mapping software, for example, was not GIS - and if you've used GIS software like QGIS, you'll know that it is not very good at generating pretty web maps. 

As we saw on the analysis side, a lot of advanced software can now be used by those with limited (or no) coding skills, and the same could be said for a lot of presentation tools. The Timeline.js tool is web-based, and Leaflet does require some code, but can be run by editing code templates rather than having to design it from scratch. Inkscape is a very powerful tool to design posters and graphics (again, from existing, professional templates), making these kind of materials more accessible.

Anybody can do it! - But of course, can we do it right? I designed a pretty rudimentary poster on Inkscape; it was fairly easy to do for someone like me who does not have any graphic design skills, but it's not the most compelling poster. Similarly, for Leaflet, how far can I go without getting into making errors? The Mapwarper tool, for instance, has an easy-to-use GUI that lets me manipulate maps without knowing any coding. But there is some complex cartography happening under the surface that I may not fully understand - and therefore be able to verify.
